# Contributing to Synergi  



We're excited you want to contribute to Synergi! Open source projects live and die based on the support of their community. Here's how you can help:

## Vision and Roadmap

First, get familiar with Synergi by reading the [README](README.md) and [Roadmap](roadmap.md). Understand our vision for an open source AI assistant and how we plan to build it. See where your skills and interests align to provide the most value.

### Making Changes: Fork, Branch, Commit, PR

1. Fork the Synergi repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork and create a dedicated branch for your contribution 
3. Make changes by adding, updating or removing relevant files
4. Commit changes frequently with clear messages 
5. Push commits to your fork and open a PR against the `master` branch

### Discuss Major Changes in Issues

For significant changes, especially architectural changes or new features, please start by opening an issue. This allows for discussion and feedback to ensure your work is aligned with Synergi's needs and roadmap. 

## PR Guidelines

Your pull request should:

- Have a descriptive title and summary
- Be based on the `master` branch
- Have clean, well-documented, and standards-aligned code
- Include relevant updates or additions to tests
- Be reviewed and approved by at least one project maintainer before merging

### Be Constructive

The goal is to make Synergi the best it can be. Contributions that do not match this vision or are low quality may be rejected. Do not take it personally. Provide respectful feedback and discussion. Our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) applies.
