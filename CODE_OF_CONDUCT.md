# Synergi Code of Conduct

The Synergi community is dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for everyone. We aim to make participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language 
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism 
- Focusing on what is best for the community  
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks 
- Public or private harassment 
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. 

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in the Synergi community. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment where people feel respected and safe to join together in creating something greater than ourselves. Thank you for doing your part!

This code of conduct expresses values of inclusiveness, respect, empathy, fairness and accountability that should guide interactions within the Synergi community. It establishes clear standards of acceptable behavior as well as processes for enforcement and managing abuse or other issues. The overall tone is positive and constructive while taking community governance seriously. Please provide any feedback or suggestions for improving this draft code of conduct. The goal is to promote an optimistic, collaborative culture where the best ideas win, not the loudest voices.
